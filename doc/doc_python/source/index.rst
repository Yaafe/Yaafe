Yaafe - audio features extraction
=================================

*Yaafe* is an audio features extraction toolbox.

**Easy to use**
	The user can easily declare the features to extract and their parameters in a text file.
	Features can be extracted in a batch mode, writing CSV or H5 files. The user can also extract
	features with Python or Matlab.
	
**Efficient**
	*Yaafe* automatically identifies common intermediate representations (spectrum, envelope, autocorrelation, ...) and computes them only once.
	Extraction is processed block per block so that arbitrarily long files can be processed, and memory occupation is low.

If you wonder about the *Yaafe* acronym, it's just *Yet Another Audio Feature Extractor*.

Project's status
----------------

.. highlights::
	Current version is Yaafe |version|,  released on 2011-11-07.

*Yaafe* may evolve in future versions, but current code is pretty stable and feature computation is already reliable.
*Yaafe* is already used in some Music Information Retrieval systems.

*Yaafe* provides:

* a great collection of classical audio features, with transformations and temporal integration (see :doc:`Available features documentation </features>`).
* reading of WAV, OGG, MP3 (and others) audio file formats.
* CSV and HDF5 output file formats
* Python and Matlab bindings to extract features straight within your favorite environment.
* automatic input samplerate conversion, using `smarc <http://audio-smarc.sourceforge.net>`_.
* an extensible framework that allow you to create your own feature library.
* a C++ API to efficiently integrate *Yaafe* in your project
