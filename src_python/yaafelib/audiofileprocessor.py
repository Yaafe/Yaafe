        A AudioFileProcessor object allow to extract features from
        audio files, and possibly write output features into files.

        It must be provided with a configured :py:class:`Engine`.

        Here is how to extract features from audio files and get it
        as numpy arrays:

        .. testsetup:: afp

            import doctestenv
            audiofile = doctestenv.audiofile
            dataflow_file = doctestenv.dataflow_file


        .. doctest:: afp

            >>> # configure your engine
            >>> engine = Engine()
            >>> engine.load(dataflow_file)
            True
            >>> # create your AudioFileProcessor
            >>> afp = AudioFileProcessor()
            >>> # leave output format to None
            >>> afp.processFile(engine, audiofile)
            0
            >>> # retrieve features from engine
            >>> feats = engine.readAllOutputs()
            >>> # do what you want with your feature data
            >>> feats['mfcc']
            array([[...]])

        To write features directly to output files, just set an output
        format with the :py:meth:`setOutputFormat` method.
